    "## Variation\n",
    "All natural and artificial systems have inherent variation. Variation refers the the differences that occur in a group of observations, especially a group of measurements of a particular charateristic (e.g. length of specific fruit rather that variation in category of fruit). A small variation indicates that there is only a little difference among the measurments, while a large variation indicates that a large difference exists among the members."
