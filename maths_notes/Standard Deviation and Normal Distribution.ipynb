    "This means that, on average, the stock's closing price deviated from the weekly mean by about £2.316. A higher standard deviation would indicate a greater volatility, suggesting that the stock's price is more spread out over a range of values, which would be seen as riskier by investors. Conversely, a lower standard deviation indicates less volatility and potentially less risk."
